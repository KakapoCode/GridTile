# GridTile
8/10/2020. Jonathan S.

Display a simple Binary Tree Maze in the console. Simplifying the project from earlier versions. I plan on doing the more complete, non-console version, with multiple types of Mazes, at a later date. 

The Grid class handles creation of the Tile objects, the Binary Tree Maze, and the displaying of the Grid. 

The Tiles class handles setting the Location of relevant tile boundaries (In our version, the Southmost and Eastmost tiles).
